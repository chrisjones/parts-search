Delete Index

$ curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/'
The above example deletes an index called twitter. Specifying an index, alias or wildcard expression is required.

The delete index API can also be applied to more than one index, or on all indices (be careful!) by using _all or * as index.

In order to disable allowing to delete indices via wildcards or _all, set action.destructive_requires_name setting in the config to true. This setting can also be changed via the cluster update settings api.
